# Moving Sounds Scene

This as a Decentraland Scene built using the Creator Hub and the SDK7.
Some items in the scene turn on and off sounding spheres, which are moving in different directions.

The idea is to tinker around with the audio panning and volume of the different audio layers.

## Setup

To set this scene up, you should drag and drop 4 items into the scene, and give them this specific names:

```
musicItem
taoismItem
birdItem
waterItem
```

This item names will be used in the code to define them as triggers of cetain audio files. Those files are:

```
water.mp3
nature.mp3 (birds)
taoism.mp3
music.mp3
```
